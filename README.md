Andrew-Miriam-Project
=====================

Project 1: JS + HTML

The input in this project comes from the user in the form of answers to quiz questions.
The output will be a correct/incorrect confirmation message, displayed below the submission button.
The quiz is about Seattle history, as we are in Seattle.
Fun fact: You can enter "7" or "seven" in on question two, and both are acceptable answers!
